% writeMPfiles(X,foldername,tag,range)
% This program is called by importData.m

% Inputs
% X: a 3-D array with dimensions LxMxN, where L = length
% of the signal, M = Number of trials and N = Number of channels

% foldername and tag: the MP data files are created in
% foldername/tag/ImportData/

% range (= [L1 L2]) is an optional two vector array that specifies the chunk of
% signal to be taken for gabor analysis. X(:,L1:L2) is taken for analysis.
% If not specified, the entire signal is taken.
