% [signal,t,normSignal] = reconstructAtom(oct,u,ksi,fi,N,range)

% This program reconstructs the signal given the properties of the gabor atom

% Inputs:
% N - length of signal
% oct       - log2(scale);               % between 1 & log2(N)-1
% u         - position                   % between 0 & N-1
% ksi       - frequency                  % between 0 & N-1
% fi        - angle                      % in radians
% range - [r1 r2]                        % both r1, r2 between 0.. N-1
